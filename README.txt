Start the program by running main.py

You will be presented with a launcher window.
Choose the option you want.

Q Learning:
- You can edit the maze by clicking left and right mouse on tiles.
- You can also generate a random non door/key maze with W,
    and a door/key maze with E.
- Train an agent for the former with T, the latter with E.
- Same goes for user created mazes.

DQ Learning:
- Sorry that the instruction bar text is so small! Controls are the same as in "Q Learning".
- You cannot edit the maze yourself.
- You can generate mazes as explained under "Q Learning".

For both:
- The user can take control of the agent and test run a maze with R.
- You may cancel training by hitting ESC.
- You cannot cancel when the agent is running the maze, but
    if it gets stuck, the run will be canceled automatically after
    a certain number of steps.
- You can hit ESC or closes the window to go back to the launcher window.
